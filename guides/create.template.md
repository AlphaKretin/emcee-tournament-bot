**Add channels**
You need a public channel to start signups.
Public channels are used for signups and pairings.
```
mc!addchannel {}|public```
Private channels are used for player decks.
```
mc!addchannel {}|private```
You remove channels if you make a mistake.
```
mc!removechannel {}|public```
These commands affect the current channel.

Hosts have all the same permissions you do.
Trust them like you would a moderator.

mc!addhost {}|@User
mc!removehost {}|@User```
**Change info**
You can change the name and description.
```
mc!update {}|New Name|A new description```
