# Contributing to Emcee

Emcee is under heavy development but we welcome first-time contributors!
There are many ways to contribute:

- [report a bug or documentation problem](https://github.com/AlphaKretin/emcee-tournament-bot/issues)
- [submit a pull request](https://github.com/AlphaKretin/emcee-tournament-bot/pulls) to fix a bug or implement a feature you want to see
- [join the community on Discord](https://discord.gg/GrMGspZ)

More information on the software architecture of this project and how to run are
under construction but should be in the main README for now.
