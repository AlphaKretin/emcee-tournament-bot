![Build](https://github.com/AlphaKretin/emcee-tournament-bot/workflows/Build/badge.svg)&nbsp;
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/AlphaKretin/emcee-tournament-bot/badge.svg?t=iUM0Et)](https://coveralls.io/github/AlphaKretin/emcee-tournament-bot)

A Discord bot to facilitate organising Yu-Gi-Oh! tournaments online and verify submitted decks. Currently uses [Challonge](https://challonge.com/).

Supports YGOPro deck files (.ydk) and `ydke://` URLs from [Project Ignis: EDOPro](https://github.com/edo9300/edopro).

## Usage

This README file details the source code of this bot. For information on how to use the bot from the perspective of a Discord user, see this repository's [wiki](https://github.com/AlphaKretin/deck-parse-bot/wiki).

## Development

Emcee is written in TypeScript. It targets Node.js 14+ and can be run with or without Docker.
It uses Eris to talk to Discord and PostgreSQL for persistence.


1. Install Docker with Docker Compose, or install PostgreSQL.
1. Start Postgres. You can start up just the Postgres container with `docker-compose up -d postgres`.
1. Create a `.env` file with the required credentials and configuration. Examples below:
    - In Docker:

        ```
        POSTGRES_HOST_PORT=127.0.0.1:5432
        POSTGRES_USER=
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=
        POSTGRES_DB=
        DISCORD_TOKEN=
        CHALLONGE_USERNAME=
        CHALLONGE_TOKEN=
        OCTOKIT_TOKEN=
        ```

    - Outside Docker:

        ```
        NODE_ENV=development
        DEBUG=emcee:*
        POSTGRESQL_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/DBNAME
        DISCORD_TOKEN=
        CHALLONGE_USERNAME=
        CHALLONGE_TOKEN=
        OCTOKIT_TOKEN=
        ```

1. Start Emcee.
    - In Docker: `docker-compose up --build` and wait for the image to build.
    - Outside Docker: `yarn && yarn build && node --enable-source-maps dist`.
